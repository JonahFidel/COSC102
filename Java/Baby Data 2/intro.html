<h1>COSC 102</h1>

<h2>Program: Baby Database</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This program asks you to implement a simple database library.
The library supports a data structure that is meant to be used by other programs.
For example, this assignment comes with a program called <tt>DataExplorer</tt> that can be used to make queries on a database read from a file; the program is coded to use the database library that you will implement.
</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p><tt>DataExplorer.java</tt> contains the source code for a simple data-manipulation language.
It relies on a library that implements the <tt>DataSet</tt> interface for its functionality.
As posted, it will run correctly using the reference implementation provided in <tt>RefDataSet.class</tt>
(and the helper file <tt>RefDataSet$RDSComparator.class</tt>).
Your job is to code your own implementation of the interface to provide the same functionality as the reference implementation,
making the driver program work.
</p>

<p>In essence, you are creating a data structure for a text data table.  This data is described by a set of fields, or columns in a table.
Each row represents one item of data, or a record.  It is not necessary that all records contain data for all fields.
For example, the fields of an address book might be Name, Address, and Phone;
each record would represent an individual's listing the address book, and may or may not contain an address and phone.
We'll assume the first field uniquely identifies each record in the data;
<i>e.g.</i>, there are no duplicate names.
</p>

<p>Data is stored on disk in a semicolon-separated-data (ssd) file.
The first line of the file is a list of the field names, separated by semicolons (";").
Each subsequent line is a data record, with field data for that record separated by semicolons.
An empty string between semicolons means that there is no data for the corresponding field;
there may also be fewer fields and/or semicolons than fields in the header line,
also indicating absence of data.
</p>

<p>The query language allows users to identify and print subsets of the data, for example,
a user may just want to print names and phone numbers of records containing "Ms." in the name field.
The library provides support for manipulating sets of data through methods.</p>

<p>There are two additional HTML documentation files for this assignment.  You should read these once you have looked at this Introduction page:
<ul>
<li><a href="dataset.html">information about the methods the library must provide</a></li>
<li><a href="driver.html">information about how to use the DataExplorer driver program</a></li>
</ul></p>


<h4>Structure of Files</h4>

<p><tt>DataExplorer.java</tt> contains the source code for the driver program.
Line 21 of that file creates a new <tt>RefDataSet</tt> object in which to store the data read from a file.
To use your implementation instead, simply change the constructor call in that line of the source code and recompile.</p>

<p>The methods used in <tt>DataExplorer</tt> are all delcared in the interface <tt>DataSet</tt>, also provided as source code.
Any implementation must provide code for all the methods declared there (even if they do nothing).
The reference implementation, <tt>RefDataSet</tt>, implements all of these methods <a href="dataset.html">as described in the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the <tt>DataSet</tt> interface is the source code for a <tt>DataSetException</tt> class.
This checked exception is used to signal problems encountered during runtime of the library.
The <tt>DataExplorer</tt> program will print error messages appropriately when these exceptions occur.</p>

<p>Several sample data files are provided with the extension <tt>.ssd</tt>.  These are plain-text files that you can open in a text editor,
and you can also create your own files for testing.</p>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Your job is to provide an implementation of the <tt>DataSet</tt> data structure.  Therefore you must write your own class
that implements that interface and submit code for it and any helper classes.  You must not modify any of the files provided,
except for changing line 20 of <tt>DataExplorer.java</tt> so that you can test your own implementation.
You do not need to submit the changed <tt>DataExplorer.java</tt> file.</p>

<p>Your implementation should subscribe to the behavior <a href="dataset.html">described in the documentation</a>.
It is your job to implement the class as you wish, deciding on what types of instance variables to use to store the data.
Of course, you are free to add any helper functions to manipulate that data.</p>

<h4>Suggested Plan of Attack</h4>

<ol>

<li>First, read all the documentation carefully.  After this page, read <a href="driver.html">the instructions for the driver program</a> 
and then read <a href="dataset.html">the description of the <tt>DataSet</tt> interface</a>.</li>

<li>Download all the starter files and compile the Java source.  You should be able to run the driver program and test
some of its functionality using the given reference implementation and the instructions for the driver program.</li>

<li>Once you get a feel for how datasets can be manipulated, then sketch out how you will store the data in your implementation.
Think about the various methods / operations and figure out how those work with your implementation.
<em>The more time you spend planning out your implementation to support all the methods, the less time you'll spend coding and debugging.</em>
</li>

<li>Approach the method implementations step-by-step.  For example, it's important first to get <tt>load()</tt> working so that
you have some data.  Use debugging <tt>print</tt> statements to make sure the data looks like it should.
After <tt>load()</tt> works, implement the various <tt>get...()</tt> methods so that you can at least print an entire
dataset without doing any manipulation.  Then start working on the operations, probably starting with the <tt>include()</tt>
methods.</li>

<li>Save the sorting for last, but be aware that certain designs are more compatible with easy implementations of sort than others.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Helpful Pointers</h4>

<p>The Java API has some great information:<ul>

<li>You probably want to use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">Scanner</a> to read the file input line-by-line.  When you do, you probably want to use the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)">String.split()</a> method to convert the line into an array of Strings, specifying that you want to split on semicolons.</li>

<li>For doing the various searching and filtering, try methods in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String</a> API.
The driver program translates all text to lowercase, and your searches and comparisons should be case-insensitive,
but you'll probably want to keep the actual data intact without any changes to case so that the printed output matches the data in the file.</li>

<li>You're allowed to use collections from the Java library for this assignment, including <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>s.  The point is that your implementation is separate from the interface.</li>

<li>You can use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">Arrays.sort()</a> or <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List, java.util.Comparator)">Collections.sort()</a> to help you sort.
You can do a Google search for examples on this; for example, I found <a href="http://www.vogella.de/blog/2009/08/04/collections-sort-java/">this blog post</a> with an example of sorting an ArrayList.
</li>
