<h1>COSC 102</h1>

<h2>Program: Baby Database</h2>

<h3>Driver Program Instructions</h3>

<p>The <tt>DataExplorer</tt> driver program provides a console interface to the <tt>DataSet</tt> backend.  This page outlines the syntax for input to this driver program.</p>

<h4>Running the program</h4>

<p>To execute the driver program, you must provide the name of the file to read as a command-line argument.
It is expected that the file is in the semicolon-separated-data (ssd) format.</p>

<p>Running<blockquote><tt>java DataExplorer comets.ssd</tt></blockquote>will launch the driver program and load data from the <tt>comets.ssd</tt> file.
The program then waits for input from the console.
Note that if you have a textfile containing a script, you can run that script using command-line redirection; for example:
<blockquote>
<tt>java DataExplorer comets.ssd &lt; script.de &gt; output.txt</tt>
</blockquote>
would run the commands in the file <tt>script.de</tt> and save the data printed to <tt>output.txt</tt>.  (Note that redirection is a function of the shell and not the driver program itself; this will work in a terminal but not necessarily in an IDE such as Dr. Java, but this invocation of the program is just for convenience.)
By default, it will take input from <tt>stdin</tt> and print to <tt>stdout</tt> with error messages directed at <tt>stderr</tt>.
</p>

<h4>High-level description</h4>

<p>The program supports 5 "variables" for datasets, numbered 0 through 4.  There are a set of commands that you can use in "main mode," which do not pertain to the definition of a particular variable.
If you use the <tt>begin</tt> command to start specifying the contents of one of the datasets, the program will enter "data mode" until you use the <tt>end</tt> command.
Commands entered in "data mode" pertain to the active dataset variable.
Each command is valid in its respective mode only.
</p>

<p>Lines are counted and line numbers are used in error messages.  This is especially useful when running a script from the command line.
Blank lines are counted but are ignored.
The command name is the first word in a line; any parameters follow with parameters divided by whitespace.
Note that if you want to use a space in a parameter, use an underscore instead.
(Underscores in data files are not supported.)
</p>

<p>Here is a sample set of commands that would work on the comets dataset:
<blockquote><pre>
begin 0
starts name p/s
end

begin 1
starts name p/t
end

begin 2
copy 0
union 1
starts perihelion_time 94
asort perihelion_time
include name perihelion_time
end

print 2
exit
</pre></blockquote>
The first three sections of commands define datasets to be stored in variables 0, 1, and 2.  The first block starts with a <tt>begin</tt> statement that has a parameter 0, meaning that all commands until <tt>end</tt> pertain to the definition of this dataset.
When <tt>begin</tt> is executed, a copy of the entire original dataset loaded from the file is placed in the variable;
subsequent commands can manipulate that dataset.
For example, the block for variable 0 selects records where the comet name begins with "p/s" and the block for variable 1 does the same for names beginning with "p/t".
All input gets converted to lowercase when fed to the backend, and all searches are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>The third block starts by making a copy of dataset 0 into variable 2.  It then adds any records from dataset 1 using the <tt>union</tt> command.
In this way, dataset 2 contains all records where the comet name starts with "p/s" or "p/t".
It then selects records where the "Perihelion Time" field begins with 94 (remember that underscores are replaced with spaces),
sorts the dataset by that field, and then restricts the data to be printed to just the "Name" and "Perihelion Time" fields.</p>

<p>The last section outputs the dataset defined in variable 2, namely, the Names and Perihelion Times of comets whose names begin with "p/s" or "p/t" and whose perihelion_times begin with "94".

<h4>Commands in main mode</h4>

<tt>begin [var]</tt>
<blockquote>
Enters data mode for specifying the dataset in position [var].  [var] must be an integer in the range 0 through 4.
This command automatically resets the dataset in position [var] to be the full dataset loaded from the file.
In addition, it automatically sets all fields to be included in the dataset printout.
</blockquote>

<tt>clear [var]</tt>
<blockquote>
This clears the dataset in variable position [var].  Because <tt>begin</tt> automatically resets the dataset, this command will rarely need to be used.
</blockquote>

<tt>exit</tt>
<blockquote>
This ends the program.  The driver will also end on EOF (CTRL+D or CTRL+Z depending on your system).
</blockquote>

<tt>print [var]</tt>
<blockquote>
Prints a table of the dataset defined in position [var].  If any <tt>include</tt> commands were used, the columns printed will be restricted to the fields specified.
</blockquote>


<h4>Commands in data mode</h4>

<tt>asort [field]</tt>
<blockquote>
Sorts the dataset in ascending lexical order by the field name [field].
</blockquote>

<tt>contains [field] [string]</tt>
<blockquote>
Keeps only the data records in which the data for field name [field] contains the string [string].
The search is case-insensitive, and [field] must be a valid field in the dataset.
</blockquote>

<tt>copy [var]</tt>
<blockquote>
Copies to the active variable position the dataset defined in position [var].
This also copies the included printing fields to the active dataset.
Changes to the active dataset following this command <i>should not</i> affect the other dataset in position [var].
</blockquote>

<tt>dsort [field]</tt>
<blockquote>
Sorts the dataset in descending lexical order by the field name [field].
</blockquote>

<tt>end</tt>
<blockquote>
Ends the definition of the active dataset variable and returns to main mode.
</blockquote>

<tt>include</tt><br>
<tt>include [field] ...</tt>
<blockquote>
This command specifies which fields will be included in the output table when the dataset is printed.
If no parameters are specified, all fields will be included.
If any parameters are specified, then only those fields will be included.
The commands are not cumulative, in that <tt>include name</tt> followed by <tt>include perihelion_time</tt> does not cause both those fields to be included;
each <tt>include</tt> command should be thought of as specifying a full set of fields.
Any number of fields may be specified, and specifying a field more than once should have no effect.
Also, the order does not matter; the output table may or may not be in the order specified in the <tt>include</tt> statement.
</blockquote>

<tt>intersect [var]</tt>
<blockquote>
Keeps only the data records that also appear in the dataset defined in variable position [var].
Records are considered equivalent if the contents of the first field is equal in a case-insensitive String comparison.
</blockquote>

<tt>starts [field] [string]</tt>
<blockquote>
Same as <tt>contains</tt>, except the data must start with [string] rather than simply contain [string].
</blockquote>

<tt>union [var]</tt>
<blockquote>
Joins any records present in the dataset in variable position [var] to the active dataset.
There should be no duplicate records as a result of the <tt>union</tt>, that is, if a record is present in both,
it is not duplicated in the current dataset.
